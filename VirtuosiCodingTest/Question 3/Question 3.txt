Question 3

Time taken: 30 mins

Scenario:  
Unity Developer Test 
You are asked by a producer to implement a sonar system that queries in a sphere 
around a given point, and you need to report whether an object appears on the 
sonar readout.  
Short Answer:  
Explain how it would work and how you would go about implementing such a 
system (maximum 2 paragraphs).


Answer:
========
To implement a sonar system that queries in a sphere around a given point, 
the system would first define the point in 3D space and the radius of the sphere that represents the sonar's range. The system would then iterate through 
all objects in the environment and calculate the distance from the origin to each object. 
If the distance is less than or equal to the radius, the object would be considered "detected" 
and reported on the sonar readout.

For implementation, I would use spatial partitioning techniques like a quadtree or an octree to optimize the search within the 3D space. This reduces the number of distance calculations by 
focusing only on objects that are near the query point. The Euclidean distance formula would be used 
to compute distances. Once the detected objects 
are identified, their details (e.g., type, location) would be returned or displayed on the sonar interface. 
This approach is computationally efficient and works well for real-time applications.
