Question 1 

Time Spent: 10 mins

Scenario:  
Unity Developer Test 
You are tasked with building a particle system for your team to utilize in a 3D game 
project. Your team does not have resources to implement the rendering aspects, 
so you’re tasked with defining an interface that will be utilized by your team and 
implemented later.  
The interface for the particle system needs to provide methods to satisfy the 
following requirements:  
• Given an “Type ID” integer (the type ID specifies the emitter settings: 
particle lifetime, color, velocity, etc.), the system will create a new instance 
of a particle emitter.  
• Given a particle emitter instance, the particle system can attach it to a 
model, place it at a world location, or place it at a screenspace location.  
• Given a particle emitter instance, the particle system can scale and/or 
rotate it.  
• Given a particle emitter instance, the particle system can terminate it early.  
Define an interface for the particle system and submit the file.
